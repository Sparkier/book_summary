# Book Summary

In this repository, we generate both textual summaries and image descriptions for written texts.

## Backend

In the backend folder, we generate the text summaries and images.

For now, we use an [online service](https://quillbot.com/summarize) for text summaries.

For image generation, we use scripts that call stablediffusion.

## Frontend

For now, the frontend only displays different levels of text summaries.

Images are only placeholders as of now.
