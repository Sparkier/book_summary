Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it\noccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all\nseemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its\nwaistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a\nrabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and\nburning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was\njust in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.", "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the\nworld she was to get out again.", "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped\nsuddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping\nherself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.", "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of\ntime as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen\nnext. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it\nwas too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there\nshe saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the\nshelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to\nher great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for\nfear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.", "\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this,\nI shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all\nthink me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell\noff the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)", "Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \u201cI wonder\nhow many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI\nmust be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had\nlearnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though\nthis was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as\nthere was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\n\u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but then I\nwonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no idea\nwhat Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words\nto say.)", "Presently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right through\nthe earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was\nrather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t\nsound at all the right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what\nthe name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand\nor Australia?\u201d (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy\ncurtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you\ncould manage it?) \u201cAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me\nfor asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up\nsomewhere.\u201d", "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking\nagain. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201d\n(Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice\nin the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very\nlike a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice\nbegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo\nbats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either\nquestion, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she\nwas dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand\nwith Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the\ntruth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she\ncame upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.", "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she\nlooked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,\nand the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a\nmoment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear\nit say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears and whiskers, how late\nit\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned the corner,\nbut the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,\nwhich was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.", "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice\nhad been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she\nwalked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.", "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;\nthere was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first\nthought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!\neither the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it\nwould not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a\nlow curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about\nfifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her\ngreat delight it fitted!", "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much\nlarger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the\nloveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and\nwander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\nshe could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head\nwould go through,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little\nuse without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I\nthink I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many\nout-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that\nvery few things indeed were really impossible.", "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to\nthe table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book\nof rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little\nbottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,)\nand round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDRINK\nME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters.", "It was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice\nwas not going to do that in a hurry. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll look\nfirst,\u201d she said, \u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked\n\u2018poison\u2019 or not\u201d; for she had read several nice little\nhistories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and\nother unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple\nrules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn\nyou if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply\nwith a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink\nmuch from a bottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to\ndisagree with you, sooner or later.", "However, this bottle was not marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice\nventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of\nmixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.", "*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*", "\u201cWhat a curious feeling!\u201d said Alice; \u201cI must be shutting up\nlike a telescope.\u201d", "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened\nup at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little\ndoor into that lovely garden.

I wonder what I should be\nlike then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like\nafter the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such\na thing.", "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into\nthe garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she\nfound she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the\ntable for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite\nplainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs\nof the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with\ntrying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.", "\u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to\nherself, rather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed\nit), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her\neyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated\nherself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201cBut it\u2019s no\nuse now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two people!

She is bored and tired of reading a book she has been reading, which has no conversations or pictures. Out of nowhere, an orange rabbit runs past her, talking loudly and saying that it will be late. It takes Alice a few moments to realize that the rabbit is carrying a watch in his waistcoat pocket. Curiosity overcomes her, and after chasing the rabbit down the rabbit hole, she finds herself falling into a dark, well-lit hallway. After exploring the hallway, Alice comes across a table on which there is an empty jar labeled \"Orange Marmalade\". She drops the jar but finds it empty, so instead of dropping it into the jar of marmalade she puts it into another cupboard. As she falls down the well she wonders what would happen if she were to fall through the house. On the second try, she manages to open a door made of glass. The room is full of shelves filled with things like maps, books, and other miscellaneous items. In fact, everything seems quite out of proportion to Alice's already small size. When she gets to the bottom of the stairs, though, she realizes that she cannot get out; even if she wanted to, she simply could not move her body enough to do so. Finally, she spots a bottle labeled \"Drink Me,\" on the table next to which she picks up a piece of cake. She eats a bit, then tries to decide which way to go: Either way, she decides, since eating the cake makes her grow larger. But as she does not know which path to take, she can only choose the one way. At this point, she begins to get sleepy. Her sleepiness turns to dreamy. She dreams of Dinah feeding bats, and Dinah telling her about the dangers of living with cats. Then she wakes up from her dream and finds herself in the real world. Once again, she goes back to trying to open the door to the lovely garden, but now she discovers that she has forgotten the golden key. There are many doors all around the room, all locked. To solve the problem, she tries to use the key on a three legged table that has no handles. Unfortunately, the table also has rules for preventing people from opening these doors. A third time around, Alice attempts to open yet another door. This time she finds a bottle labeling the bottle, Drink Me, containing the words &#8216does not drink"}, {"num": 2, "title": "", "paragraphs": ["\u201cCuriouser and curiouser!\u201d cried Alice (she was so much surprised,\nthat for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201cnow\nI\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!

She begins to cry, and soon a pool of water forms around her, four inches wide. The White Rabbit reappears, wearing gloves and child gloves and carrying a fan. He drops the gloves and fan and scurries off, leaving Alice unable to get out. Talking to herself in a nonsense voice, she tries to make sense of the strange events of the day, wondering if she has somehow changed back into the way things were before the time of her consciousness. Her conversation with herself consists of a series of odd turns of phrase, wordplays, and rhyming couplets. In one sequence, she mistakes a small fish for a large crocodile and a mouse for a small mouse. Other phrases she uses are: \"I can do no wrong; I am tired of the dumb things I know; I have been wronged twice; I must signify Rome, London, Paris, Luxembourg, Marseilles, Constantinople, and many other places.\" All of these phrases repeat over and over again in her head until she becomes almost speechless.

I think that will\nbe the best plan.\u201d", "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged;\nthe only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about\nit; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp\nbark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.", "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly\nstretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d\nsaid Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was\nterribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in\nwhich case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.", "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it\nout to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at\nonce, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to\nworry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being\nrun over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another\nrush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it;\nthen Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,\nand expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\nagain; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a\nvery little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its\ntongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.", "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off\nat once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the\npuppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.", "\u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves:\n\u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d\nonly been the right size to do it!

Alice looked all round her at the\nflowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like\nthe right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large\nmushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had\nlooked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her\nthat she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.", "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom,\nand her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was\nsitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and\ntaking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else."], "chapter_summary": "The White Rabbit spots Alice and commands her to fetch him some gloves and fan. Alice, frightened that the rabbit thinks she is the servant of his house, runs off in search of the items. In the process, she discovers that she has grown very large indeed. She chases after the Rabbit and succeeds in opening the door only to find herself waist-deep in a puddle of water. As she drinks from the bottle of water, she grows larger and becomes dizzy with each new growth. The White Rabbit tries to open the door again, but this time it does not work. He sends her on her way without ever offering to help. On her way home, Alice stops at a country inn where she meets the Rabbit's friendly dog, who shows her a toy: a small pink puppy. After some play with the puppy, Alice realizes that it is actually a giant pebble, which she decides to eat.

After some time, however, she realizes that there is nothing to be said, and so she tells the caterpillar that she doesn't know who she was when she got up that morning and has been changed many times over the past several days. The conversation between the two continues, and they eventually come to a mutual realization that they are both very different people. They begin to argue about what size they should be. Each tries to show which side of its personality is more suited to each other, but their argument is interrupted by the sound of a bird. The bird is a Pigeons, and it begins to chase after Alice as it tries to determine if she is a young or an old snake. When it learns that Alice is a girl, it stops chasing her and talks to her as though it were a small girl, and then it scampers away when it discovers that Alice can no longer support herself on her shoulders. This causes Alice great consternation, for since she has not yet grown to her proper height, she cannot help but feel quite out of place in this strange new body. She decides to return to her right size in order to fit into the beautiful garden. On her way back to her original size, she happens upon a four-foot high house, and thinking that whoever lives there would never expect her to encounter someone of her size, frightens her out of her wits."}, {"num": 6, "title": "", "paragraphs": ["For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do\nnext, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood\u2014(she\nconsidered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by\nhis face only, she would have called him a fish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the\ndoor with his knuckles.

The door is opened by a frog with a paper hat on its head. The Fish Footman gives the Frog Footman a letter inviting the duchess to attend a game of croquet . The two footmen inside are making such loud noises that they cannot hear Alice when she knocks on the door. They tell her that there is no point in knocking because they are all too busy making lots of noise from within the house. A large plate comes skimming across the room as if someone has dropped it. When Alice asks how she is supposed to get into the house at all, the Frogfootman replies: \"That's the very first question you know.\" He explains that he will sit here for days on end, day after day, until something happens. In the meanwhile, the Duchess nurses her baby doll, who acts like a stuffed pig. She also talks to the cat, whom she calls Fancy Cat, about which direction she should go in order to get somewhere. The cat tells her that it doesn't matter where she goes; it only matters what way she gets there. After some discussion about directions, the Cook-Duchess begins to nurse her baby again. While doing so, she tosses the baby around like a train, pretending it is a steam engine. The baby keeps trying to run away, but finally the Duchess picks it up and plays with it for a few minutes before setting it down again. On this occasion, we learn that the Duchess does not have a proper method of feeding the baby--she feeds it by twisting it into a knot and then straightening it back out again. This process repeats itself over and over again several times. At length, the baby decides to yield to the Duchesss wishes and trots off into the woods. Meanwhile, the Croquet Cat sits on a nearby tree. It greets the Duchess playfully and grins at her. The conversation between the two pets continues, with the Duchess explaining that cats can do many things besides eat and sleep. The Croquet cat shows great intelligence, including being able to understand even the tiniest details of everyday language. However, it refuses to answer any of the questions posed to it, saying instead that everything it says is meant to be completely meaningless.

There, she finds the Mad Tea-Party and the two Mads are sitting at a table having tea. They are rude to her, making rude comments about her hair, and staring at her face with blank stares. The conversation turns to riddles, which start off as a game of word games but degenerate into a discussion of time. The various characters solve riddles by saying what they mean, using words that do not have any sense or meaning to them. It is a sort of reverse Shakespearean improv. Time travel takes place on a moving train, where each character has to figure out how to move from one time period to another. The March Hare tells Alice a story about three sisters who live in the Bottom of a Well, an old fashioned well - similar to the one in Chapter 1. But instead of being able to draw water from the well itself, they can only draw it from a bottle labeled \"treacle\". In other words, treacle is a kind of liquid form of water pumped into a wheeled spring, just like the top of a drum set. This explanation makes no sense to Alice. She gets up in disgust and walks off. The others don't seem to notice that she has left. On the second day of her adventure, she tries again to find out why the people living in the Well were so ill. Once more, she goes through the door leading into the great hall. This time, however, she manages to get there much better: she uses the key given to her by the mad Hatter rather than the glass table did. Finally, she arrives at the secret passage inside the walled garden."}, {"num": 8, "title": "", "paragraphs": ["A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on\nit were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.\nAlice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and\njust as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \u201cLook out now,\nFive!

At the entrance to the garden stands a large white rose tree, which is surrounded by two gardeners dressed in red paint. Alice asks the gardeners why they are painting the rose bushes white. They explain that they have planted a white rose bush before the Queen came, and if she were to find out about it, they would all have to beheaded. The procession begins. First come ten soldiers with clubs; next come ten royal children wearing hearts; then come ten more soldiers, this time all decked out in diamonds. Next come guests, these are mostly kings and queens, and last come the Queen and the king and queen of Hearts. During the course of the procession there is a game of croquet played on a strange ground made up of sticks covered with mallets, balls, and flamingoes. The main problem for Alice is trying to get the flamingoes live under her arches so that she can croquet them. She also has to deal with the angry yelling of the Queen who wants everyone executed. While playing croquet, she meets the White rabbit who warns her that the Duchess is under sentence execution for boxing the Queen because she came too late. The game begins, and it is very confusing. There are many players and lots of different kinds of mallets. After a while, Alice realizes that she must remove the head of the cat from the severed limbs of the dead hedgehog so that it will not be beheadable. As she tries to do this, she sees the Cat and talks to it. The Cheshire cat shows its head to her and tells her what the game is like, but cannot tell her how to proceed. The King and Queen argue over whether or not one should beheaded a creature once it has been cut off its head. Alice finally decides that the solution is to ask the Duchess since she is in prison. However, when the Duke comes back without her, the cat has already disappeared. Everyone goes back to their games."}, {"num": 9, "title": "", "paragraphs": ["\u201cYou can\u2019t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old\nthing!\u201d said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into\nAlice\u2019s, and they walked off together.", "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to\nherself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when\nthey met in the kitchen.", "\u201cWhen I\u2019m a Duchess,\u201d she said to herself, (not in a\nvery hopeful tone though), \u201cI won\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen\nat all.

She tries to get Alice to agree with her, for instance, that the flamingo shouldn't put his arm around Alice's waist because he might bite; or that the mustard on Alice's dress should not be eaten because it is bad for the health. Alice listens to the Duchess list all of the things she used to learn as a child: Mystery, Mystery, Ancient and Modern Seaography, Drawling . The Duchess also teaches some of the various branches of arithmetic, such as Vertigo, Reeling, Gravitation, Distinction, Ugification, Disposition, and Gradification. All of these items have a moral. For example, if you don't understand what uglification is, just look at this picture of a grotesquely distorted image of a face. The Duchess tells Alice that there is no reason why she can't put her hand out towards Alice, even though she would like to, since the flamingoes' temper wouldn't be very good. The game of croquet is resumed, and everyone who was sentenced to execution has been taken away by soldiers. There are no prisoners left. Everyone except Alice, the king, the queen, and herself is free from the penalty of death. While they are outside playing croquet, the King and the queen come upon a garpond , which is an old fashioned version of a jail cell. They soon come upon their tutor, the Mock Turtles, whom they meet up with again. This time, the tutor informs them of the lessons he taught them about history, science, philosophy, and other subjects. After listening to the lessons, the two young people sit down to play a round of cards. In order to pass the time, however, they must first solve a riddle: What is the word \"moral?\" The answer is Moral, which means Thinking Again. It is then decided that the duchess should tell the story of how the Turtle came to be a member of the school system. The conversation goes on for quite a while, but eventually the topic turns to practical matters rather than philosophical ones. When the subject comes up again, the discussion moves to the subject of love, which the tutor points out is one of the most important things in the world. Love, according to the tutor, is something that happens when people stop paying attention to sense and start taking care of body and sound"}, {"num": 10, "title": "", "paragraphs": ["The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his\neyes.

In the confusion, Alice accidentally flings all of the jurors out of the courtroom, upsetting them and spreading all over the floor. The White Rabbit interjects with a series of remarks that prove his guilt. The court is then forced to go back to its normal deliberation procedures. The King asks Alice what she knows \"about this business. She responds, \"Nothing whatever. This leads the King to declare that her lack of knowledge is very important. However, before the court can begin to deliberate on any of the matters at hand, the White rabbit interrupts by saying, \"Unimportant,. unimportant, unimportant--unimportant-unimportant--important.\" This stops the proceedings as the King reads Rule 42 from his Notebook. At this point, the King switches to his own Notebook and reads Rule 23 from Rule 22 out of Rule 21. During this break, Alice suddenly becomes so large that she accidentally knocks over the Jury-box. Her giant size reminds her of the half-dwarf she accidentally bumped into a week earlier when she was trying to retrieve some goldfish. With the trial now restored to normal, the court once again begins to hear the tale of Alice's misadventure. As usual, there is much good and bad evidence presented by the various characters. On this occasion, however, the most of the pieces of evidence fail to make sense. For example, the piece of paper on which the Queen serves as the juror is convicted cannot be explained because it is made up of only scraps of paper with no particular rhyme or punctuation. Furthermore, the poem does not have any definite meaning. It is also has no sign of who wrote it or even if someone did write it down somewhere. All of the items on the paper are given to Alice as though none of the other characters can explain how they came to be in possession of them. After the court returns to its regular procedure, Alice goes off to tea with her older sister. While she is gone, Little Alice has a strange dream. In her dream, she sees herself and her sister playing a game of cards while simultaneously being swallowed up by a whole pack of dogs. When she finally wakes up, she tells her sister about her dream and shows her all of Wonderland's wonderful adventures. Soon thereafter, little Alice too has a vision of herself growing up to be an adult woman. Alice compares her future self to her own childhood self and imagines how"}, {"num": 13, "title": "", "paragraphs": [], "chapter_summary": ""}, {"num": 14, "title": "", "paragraphs": [], "chapter_summary": ""}], "book_summary": "The story of the novel is told in eleven chapters, which are very short. The book is an attempt by Lewis Carroll to recreate the \"magic\" of Alice adventures in her childhood. It begins with a young Alice growing to nine-feet tall and having no trouble getting out; she encounters many locked doors, none of which have any handles. She finally finds one with a label labeled \"drink me.\" After taking a bite of cake, she attempts to explore the room filled with shelves full of miscellaneous things that seem disproportionate to her already diminutive size. No matter what steps she takes, all the things grow larger, until she reaches a level of frustration where she cannot move enough to get rid of everything. An orange rabbit named Dodger sees her and chases him down the hole into a welllit hallway at the end of which is a long hallway. On finding an empty jelly jar on a table, she drops it into an empty cupboard instead of putting it back into its rightful place. This action leads her to fall down a wellspring of glass and open a secret passage. In this manner she discovers a great deal of new and strange things. A series of vices ensues as she tries various different methods to gain knowledge. Eating pieces of cake seems to make her grow large again but eventually she returns to her normal size when she meets a caterpillar who asks her about her past. Her conversations with herself consist of nonsense words not meant for her and phrases that she recites aloud. Finally she speaks French. While searching for the glove and fan the White Rabbit gives her, after which causes her to grow much larger than before. Then he scatters her while leaving her alone in the form of a pond of four-inch wide water. Wonderland's train carriages take her through time traveling from one era to another without giving her any clear sense of direction or purpose. Upon arriving at the country inn visited by the rabbit she meets his friendly dog and then a puppy whom she eats pebbles which transform her into birds, snakes, guinea pigs and rabbits. On returning to her garden she comes upon a high hedgehog whose head she has to talk to so it won't be beheaded like the Cheshire Cat. There is also a race between cats, dogs, mice and other animals. Dinah explains to Alice how to win the game of cat vs. mouse. But Alice doesn't understand the game because she still misses her beloved cat. When confronted by the Mouse she throws her litter of mice"}}
